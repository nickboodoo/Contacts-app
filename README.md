# Reflection Questions

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure by compiling and running the code to see if it functions exactly
  how I designed it to. If it deviates from my original vision, then it needs to be redone so that I have completed what I set out to accomplish.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I can interpret user needs by reviewing the list of requirements presented to me by the client. If I have completed all of the requirements set out by the client,
  then I will have accomplished my tasks. 

How do I approach designing software?
  First I look at the requirements and needs of the client. I ask myself, why am I writing this code, or what do I wish to accomplish with this code. I use these
  questions to guide me in writing my code.
